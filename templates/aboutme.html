<h2>  About me  </h2>
<br />
<br />
<p> Hello, my name is Elliott and I really like to learn about programming and how it ties to electronics/microelectronics.

  I also like hiking, Kayaking, and just about anything outdoors that involves exercise (Yeah, I know, who actually likes exercising?)

  I consider myself a hard worker and am willing to go the extra mile to accomplish a task or solve a problem, even if it takes me longer than normal.
